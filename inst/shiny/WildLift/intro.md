> Quantifying the trade-offs associated with alternative
> recovery actions for threatened species

**WildLift** can be used to quantitatively compare the **costs** and 
demographic **benefits** of recovery actions for an iconic threatened species, 
woodland caribou (*Rangifer tarandus caribou*).
While we use caribou as a case study, our approach to developing this 
management tool is transferable to other threatened taxa.

The tool consists of a generalized matrix population model that is 
parametrized based on information from the published literature or ongoing
experiments. Users can input population parameters 
(e.g., population size and survival rates) or choose from 
pre-set caribou subpopulations to estimate changes to populations 
from implementing recovery actions. 

## Single levers

The tool estimates the trade-offs
associated with seven alternative recovery actions: 

- Linear Feature Restoration and Linear Feature Deactivation, 
- Maternal Penning,
- Conservation Breeding, 
- Predator Exclosure, 
- Wolf Reduction, and 
- Moose Reduction. 

## Multiple levers

Multiple recovery actions are compared.

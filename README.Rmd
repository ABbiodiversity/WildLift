# WildLift

>  An Open-source Tool to Guide Decisions for Wildlife Conservation

[![Linux build status](https://travis-ci.org/ABbiodiversity/WildLift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ABbiodiversity/WildLift)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ABbiodiversity/WildLift/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ABbiodiversity/WildLift)

**WildLift** can be used to quantitatively compare the **costs** and 
demographic **benefits** of recovery actions for an iconic threatened species, 
woodland caribou (*Rangifer tarandus caribou*).
While we use caribou as a case study, our approach to developing this 
management tool is transferable to other threatened taxa.

The tool consists of a generalized matrix population model that is 
parametrized based on information from the published literature or ongoing
experiments. Users can input population parameters 
(e.g., population size and survival rates) or choose from 
pre-set caribou subpopulations to estimate changes to populations 
from implementing recovery actions. 

The tool estimates the trade-offs
associated with seven alternative recovery actions: 

* Linear Feature Restoration, 
* Linear Feature Deactivation, 
* Maternal Penning, 
* Conservation Breeding, 
* Predator Exclosure, 
* Wolf Reduction, and 
* Moose Reduction.

Multiple recovery actions are compared allowing users to combine 
demographic augmentation (maternal penning, predator exclosure, 
and conservation breeding) with predator and primary prey reductions.

`WildLift::run_app()`.

## Installation

```{r install,eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ABbiodiversity/WildLift")
```

See user visible changes in the [NEWS](NEWS.md) file.

## Usage

```{r example}
library(WildLift)

## Predefined settings
(s1 <- wildlift_settings("mat.pen"))
(s2 <- wildlift_settings("pred.excl"))

## Modifying predefined settings
wildlift_settings("mat.pen", c.surv.capt=0.65, pen.cap=30)

## Forecast based on settings for 75% females penned
f1 <- wildlift_forecast(s1, fpen.prop = 0.75)
f2 <- wildlift_forecast(s2, fpen.prop = 0.75)

## Most important results summarized
summary(f1)
summary(f2)

## Plot the results
plot(f2)
lines(f1, col = 2)
legend("topleft", col = c(1,1,2), lty = c(2,1,1),
    legend = c("No pen", "Mat pen", "Pred excl"))

## Find 'breakeven' proportion of females penned where lambda=1
(b1 <- wildlift_breakeven(f1, lambda = 1))
(b2 <- wildlift_breakeven(f2, lambda = 1))
f3 <- wildlift_forecast(s1, fpen.prop = b1)
f4 <- wildlift_forecast(s2, fpen.prop = b2)
## See that lines are truly flat
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(f3, main = "Mat pen")
plot(f4, main = "Pred excl")
par(op)

## Forecast using number of penned females
## - it can be an initial number
## - or a vector of individuals for subsequent years
wildlift_forecast(s1, fpen.inds = 5)
wildlift_forecast(s2, fpen.inds = c(5, 0, 4, 6))
```
